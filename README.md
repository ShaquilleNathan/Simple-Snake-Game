## 🎮 Features

- ✅ **Score System**: The score increases every time the snake eats a red block (the "food").
- ✅ **Snake Growth**: For every point scored, the snake’s body increases by one block.
- ✅ **Game Over Logic**: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the wall.
- 🚧 **Experimental**: This project is still in a very basic phase and is built mainly for experimentation and learning purposes.

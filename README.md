# 🐍 Snake Game

A basic experimental Snake Game built using only HTML. This project is a simple recreation of the classic snake arcade game, developed as a learning experience in fundamental web game development.

## 🎮 Features

- ✅ **Score System**: The score increases every time the snake eats a red block (the "food").
- ✅ **Snake Growth**: For every point scored, the snake’s body increases by one block.
- ✅ **Game Over Logic**: The game will reload and back to its short body if the snake collides with itself.
- 🚧 **Experimental**: This project is still in a very basic phase and is built mainly for experimentation and learning purposes.
